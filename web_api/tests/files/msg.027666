Now appearing outside 10-500! (Barker Engineering Library lobby)

Lots of cellophane sleeves for greeting cards. I used to sell greeting 
cards, and used these for the packaging.

1 bicycle helmet circa 1996. Never been in an accident, though.

1 tattered French-English dictionary.

1 French grammar book from "Teach Yourself" series.

1 SAT preparation workbook.

1 harness for medium-sized dog (adjustable).

Please don't email me -- just come, snag and post!

Thanks,
Amy
